    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the [CCP-BioSim](http://www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk) workshop on [BioSimSpace](https://biosimspace.org), the EPSRC flagship software project. In this workshop you'll learn how to use BioSimSpace to write robust and portable molecular workflow components and interact directly with running molecular dynamics processes inside of a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a computational chemist you are likely overwhelmed by the amount of different software packages that are available to you. Having choice is a good thing, but too much can become a burden. I'm sure you have all, at times, come across at least one of the following conundrums:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do I know what is the best tool for the job?\n",
    "* How much time should I invest in learning this new package?\n",
    "* How can I possibly become an expert in everything?\n",
    "* How can I share my incredible script with a collaborator who doesn't use the same software.\n",
    "* Will my workflow break if I upgrade to the latest version of my favourite package?\n",
    "* Will I get the same result if I re-run my analysis from last month? \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these problems is the core goal of BioSimSpace. The wealth of fantastic software in our community is a real asset but _interoperability_ is currently a problem. Since there is no point reinventing the wheel, BioSimSpace is not an attempt to produce yet another molecular simulation package that reproduces all of the functionality from existing programs. This would result in just another tool for you to learn, along with yet another set of standards and formats. Instead, BioSimSpace is essentially just a set of _shims_, or bits of _glue_, that connect together existing software packages, allowing you to interact with them using a consistent Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "With BioSimSpace you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write generic workflow components _once_ in a package-agnostic language.\n",
    "* Run the same script from the command-line, Jupyter, or your within various workflow engines.\n",
    "* Know that you are running your job using the most suitable package that is availabe on your computer.\n",
    "* Continue using your favourite package X but be able to share scripts with your collaborator who prefers package Y.\n",
    "* Publish workflow components online and search our database for others that may be of use to you.\n",
    "* Be able to take advantage of new software packages and hardware resources as and when they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecular dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core features of BioSimSpace is the ability to set up and run [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) (MD) simulations. There are a large number of packages that can run molecular dynamics for biomolecules and BioSimSpace supports several of these: [AMBER](http://ambermd.org), [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org), and [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd). We also have our own built in GPU accelerated molecular dynamics engine, SOMD, as a fall back in case no other packages are installed. (SOMD is a wrapper around the excellent [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) package.)\n",
    "\n",
    "While, broadly speaking, the different molecular dynamics engines offer a similar range of features, their interfaces are quite different. This makes it hard to take expertise in one package and immediately apply it to another. At the heart of this problem is the incompatibility between the molecular file formats used by the different packages. While they all contain the same information, i.e. how atoms are laid out in space and how they interact with each other, the structure of the files is very different. In order to provide interoperability betwen packages we will need to be able to read and write many different file formats, and be able to interconvert between them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Boring as file parsers are, this is perhaps the most fundamental part of BioSimSpace. Without it, nothing else would work! BioSimSpace can read and write a large number of common molecular file formats, and where possible, can interconvert between many of these too. Let's import the BioSimSpace Python package and see what we can do. For convenience, we'll rename the package to BSS to save us typing:"
