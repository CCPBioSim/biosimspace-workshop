# Introduction to BioSimSpace

## Aimed at: 
Anyone interested in learning how to use the new CCP-BioSim 
[BioSimSpace](https://biosimspace.org) Python environment for easy setup, running, management and analysis of biomolecular simulations.

## Requirements: 
Knowledge of Python, e.g. as gained from the 
<a href="https://ccpbiosim.github.io/python_and_data" target="_blank">Python for Biomolecular Modellers</a> workshop. 
The material from the Python workshops is online and is self-study, in case you 
are not able to attend the earlier workshop.

## Abstract: 
BioSimSpace is the new flagship software being produced in partnership with CCP-BioSim/HEC-BioSim. The software provides an easy-to-use Python environment for manipulating biomolecules, running simulations, and analysing / visualising outputs. BioSimSpace hides the details of using individual simulation and analysis packages behind a common, simple Python interface. This enables you to setup, run and analyse simulations using, e.g. Amber, NAMD or Gromacs, all from the same Python script or Jupyter Python interface.

## Training Material

The workshop consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks. These are available
below, and can be run using the 
<a href="https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/bristol2018/server.html" target="_blank">workshop jupyter server</a>.

Once you have started the server, navigate to the `biosimspace_workshop` directory and you will find the
notebooks there.
